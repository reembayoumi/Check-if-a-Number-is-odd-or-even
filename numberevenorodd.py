# Python program to check if the input number is odd or even.
# A number is even if division by 2 gives a remainder of 0.
# If the remainder is 1, it is an odd number.

# This program adds two numbers

num1 = 1.5
num2 = 6.3

# Add two numbers
sum = num1 + num2

# Display the sum
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))
